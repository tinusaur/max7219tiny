MAX7219Led8x8 is a C library for working with the MAX7219 display driver to control 8x8 LED matrix. It is intended to be used with the Tinusaur board but should also work with any other board based on ATtiny85 or similar microcontroller.

This library is written in plain C and does not require any additional libraries to function except those that come with the WinAVR SDK.
