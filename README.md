MAX7219tiny - Tinusaur MAX7219 Library for LED 8x8 Matrix

MAX7219tiny is a C library for working with the MAX7219 display driver to control an 8x8 LED matrix. It is intended to be used with the Tinusaur boards but should also work with any other board based on ATtiny85 or a similar microcontroller.
