MAX7219/MAX7221
http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/power/display-power-control/MAX7219.html
The MAX7219/MAX7221 are compact, serial input/output common-cathode display drivers that interface microprocessors (µPs) to 7-segment numeric LED displays of up to 8 digits, bar-graph displays, or 64 individual LEDs. Included on-chip are a BCD code-B decoder, multiplex scan circuitry, segment and digit drivers, and an 8x8 static RAM that stores each digit.

Arduino Game of Life on 8x8 LED Matrix
http://brownsofa.org/blog/2010/12/30/arduino-8x8-game-of-life/
I was messing around with some Christmas toys and threw together a Conway’s Game Of Life implementation together on my Arduino.  I just love how quick it is to get things up and running on this platform.  It took me longer to solder a platform for the LED matrix to raise it up off the breadboard so the wires would all fit than the whole rest of the project.

Dot Matrix Pen Write Screen
http://www.elecfreaks.com/7138.html
In the current market where capacitive touch screens, resistive touch screens, TFT displays are flooding, DIY enthusiasts have been rarely used dot matrix screens. Here we use 5mm 8 * 8 dot matrix screen and phototransistor to achieve a pen write function.

Conway's Game of Life
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conways_Game_of_Life
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

Oscillator (cellular automaton)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillator_(cellular_automaton)
In a cellular automaton, an oscillator is a pattern that returns to its original state, in the same orientation and position, after a finite number of generations. Thus the evolution of such a pattern repeats itself indefinitely. Depending on context, the term may also include spaceships as well.

Oscillator
http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Oscillator
An oscillator is a pattern that is a predecessor of itself. That is, it is a pattern that repeats itself after a fixed number of generations (known as its period). The term is usually restricted to finite patterns that are not still lifes, though still lifes may be thought of as oscillators with period 1. An oscillator is divided into a rotor and a stator.
