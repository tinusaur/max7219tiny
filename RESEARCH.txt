MAX7219/MAX7221
http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/power/display-power-control/MAX7219.html
The MAX7219/MAX7221 are compact, serial input/output common-cathode display drivers that interface microprocessors (µPs) to 7-segment numeric LED displays of up to 8 digits, bar-graph displays, or 64 individual LEDs. Included on-chip are a BCD code-B decoder, multiplex scan circuitry, segment and digit drivers, and an 8x8 static RAM that stores each digit.

Arduino Game of Life on 8x8 LED Matrix
http://brownsofa.org/blog/2010/12/30/arduino-8x8-game-of-life/
I was messing around with some Christmas toys and threw together a Conway’s Game Of Life implementation together on my Arduino.  I just love how quick it is to get things up and running on this platform.  It took me longer to solder a platform for the LED matrix to raise it up off the breadboard so the wires would all fit than the whole rest of the project.
